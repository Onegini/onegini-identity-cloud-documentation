# Admin API

This section describes the REST APIs that are used for system configuration of Onegini Access.

## Authentication

All of the endpoints contained within the Admin API are secured by API client credentials. To configure an API client, see the [API Configuration topic guide](../../topics/technical-app-management/api-configuration/api-configuration.md).

It requires an API client with the scope `onegini_api_admin` (Admin API).
