On the left-hand side you see your mobile app where the OneWelcome Mobile Identity & Access solution provides options for Authentication processes like enrollment and strong customer authentication. Within these processes you can use a wide range of authenticators. We natively provide a PIN mechanism and seamless integration with biometric solutions like fingerprint and facial recognition authentication on mobile devices.

On the server side you'll manage and control all the rules and configuration like a pin policy, the applicable mobile OS versions your users have to use or which fallback mechanism between authenticators you allow. Out of the box you can configure a wide range of security features like:

- App integrity protection (tampering protection)
- Device integrity protection (jailbreak detection)
- Secure server communication (payload encryption)
- Secure user authentication

On the right-hand side you see the server side functionality where you provide the apps with data and monitor and control the flows and traffic. The OneWelcome Mobile Identity & Access solution uses OAuth 2.0 tokens to protect your APIs. This makes sure your customers have access to their resources.
