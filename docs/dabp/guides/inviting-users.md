# Inviting users in DABP
In order to invite a user to a group in DABP you must have `Manage group members` permission.
For example, the screen below shows the button "New User" that can be used to invite a user to a group named `sub2`. 
`sub2` is a subgroup of `test_group_for_docs`.

On the invite details, you must provide the email address and personal information of the person you want to invite. You can also assign him permissions and policies upfront.

## Why sometimes I see person details when inviting a new user
Inviting a user is making him a member of a specific group.
The form will automatically get filled with person details when an e-mail of an existing user is entered.
The person that is being invited can have an account in the identity management system because he is already part of another DABP group or has registered an account by other means.

You will have to fill in the person details manually if a user wasn't found by the e-mail address.
In this scenario will the person also get invited to create a user account.
