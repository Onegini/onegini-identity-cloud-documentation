# Responsible disclosure policy

In the unlikely event that security issues are found within Onegini Access, the responsible disclosure policy allows individuals to easily communicate 
their findings to Onegini. This allows us to further strengthen the security of our products with minimal overhead.

## Configuration

In order to enable communication of Onegini's responsible disclosure policy, you must first enable it on the 
[Features](../topics/technical-app-management/system-features-config/system-features-config.md) tab.

When enabled, Onegini's responsible disclosure policy for security issues will be made available on `/oauth/.well-known/security.txt` endpoint.

We strongly recommend enabling this feature if you want security issues to be directly communicated with Onegini.
