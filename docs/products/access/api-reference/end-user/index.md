# End user API

This section covers the end user API. It provides user and device management capabilities to an application, which can in turn provide this functionality 
wrapped in a UI to the end user.

## Authentication

All endpoints contained within the end user API are secured via an API client. To configure an API client, see the [API Configuration topic guide](../../topics/technical-app-management/api-configuration/api-configuration.md).
