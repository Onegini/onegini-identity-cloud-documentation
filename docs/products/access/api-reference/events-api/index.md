Event type needs to be given in uppercase and with a underscore (`_`) as a separator. Multiple parameters are allowed. 
| exclude_event_type | AUTHZ_REQUEST_GRANT_CREATED                  | Return events of a specific type. See [appendix](../../appendix/access-events.md) for a complete list of events. Event type needs to be given in uppercase and with a underscore (`_`) as a separator. Multiple parameters are allowed.

All search criteria filters are optional, when multiple filters are specified all conditions need to be met (ie. conditions are combined using `AND` operator).
`event_type` is the only exception where it will use an `OR` so you can filter on a specific set of events.
The results are sorted descending by a timestamp (latest first).
