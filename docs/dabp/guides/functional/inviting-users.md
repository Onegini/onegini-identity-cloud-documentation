# Inviting users in DABP
To invite a person to a group in DABP you must have the `Invite/remove group members` permission.
For example, the screen below shows the button "New user" that can be used to invite a user to the active group, in this case, a group named `sub2`. 
In this scenario, `sub2` is a subgroup of the group `test_group_for_docs`.

##Inviting a new person
When you invite a new person to a group, you must provide the email address, first name, last name, and phone number of the person you want to invite. 
You then select the permissions and/or policies you want to assign to that person. As a general rule, you will not create an account without any policies or permissions.

After finishing the form to invite a user, the user will be invited via email to create an account. Once the account is created, the user can to login with the assigned policies and permissions.

## Inviting an existing person
When you invite a user to a group you always have to enter an email address.
Based on this email address we will do a look-up if the email address already exists within another group.
If this is the case, you will see that the other fields are filled automatically, you won't be able to make changes to these details.
Also, if an existing user is invited to a new (sub)group they will not be informed about this new membership.
Simply, the next time they log in they will have the new policies and/or permissions for that new group.
