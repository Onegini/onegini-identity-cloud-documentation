Public docs for the Onegini identity cloud on readthedocs.

## Documentation strategy
We aim to provide documentation on a platform-level and no longer on a product-level. As we believe that clients and prospects need functional information to discover (new) features. We should explain the concepts that we use and point (potential) customers to the proper place to configure a feature. 

The admin interface must be self-explanatory. Therefore, information about what a certain field does will be made available on the admin page, for the general concepts we will refer to a documentation page. We will **not** create pages with screenshots etc that meticulously describe what a customer can do on a certain page in the admin panel. 

## Documentation rules
* All abbreviations need to be introduced before they are used on a specific page
* All pages should start with an introduction to provide context and assumptions 
* Technical documentation on the APIs and SDK should be separate (as we want to generate those) but might be referenced

## Documentation structure
These ten sections, with customer-friendly names, will be used as a structure for knowledge pages 

* Identity Management
  * User registration (onboarding)
  * User self-service
* Third party identity provider 
* Strong (multi-factor) authentication
* Single sign-on (SSO)
* Device registration and management
* Secure mobile apps
* Client environment embedding (implementation) 
* CIAM for B2B
* Monitoring, Logging & alerting 
* API descriptions
* Self-styling
