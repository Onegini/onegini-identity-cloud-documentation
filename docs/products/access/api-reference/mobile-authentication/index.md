# Mobile Authentication

This section describes the API for mobile authentication. A website can use this API to authenticate a user or authorize a transaction via their mobile device.
There are several options to handle the mobile authentication: the user can confirm a push message via a mobile application, enter a code that is sent via SMS 
or scan a QR code that contains a one time password. When a higher level of security is demanded, the mobile app can require additional authentication when the
user approves the transaction.
