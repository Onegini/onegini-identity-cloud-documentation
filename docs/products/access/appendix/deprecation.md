# Deprecation

Some existing features within OneWelcome Access may become deprecated at some point for various reasons. We won't remove deprecated features 
immediately. This makes it possible to upgrade OneWelcome Access while using the existing versions of the external systems that depend on it. Keep 
in mind that the deprecated features may be removed in the future. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you use the latest endpoints after previous
versions have been deprecated.

## Deprecated API endpoints

Currently, no API endpoints have been marked as deprecated.
