# Next steps

After following the [minimal configuration](example-apps-minimal-config.md) you're ready for next steps. 

## Adding features and controls
You can find information on how to add features like [mobile authentication](../../topics/mobile-apps/index.md) in the 
the [various topic guides](../../topics/index.md). 

## Production ready?

To be *production ready*, you want to consider many things like:

* Disable [development mode](../../topics/mobile-apps/app-configuration/app-configuration.md#development-mode)
* Review the enabled and used versions in [version management](../../topics/mobile-apps/app-configuration/app-version-management.md)
* Review which [mobile platform](../../topics/general-app-config/os-version-configuration/os-version-configuration.md) you want to allow 
* Review your [pin policy](../../topics/general-app-config/pin-policy/pin-policy.md)
* Enable security controls like encrypting all communication between the mobile device and the server. 

By no means is the above an extensive list.
