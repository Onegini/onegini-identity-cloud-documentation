# Messaging Service

## What is Messaging service?
*Messaging service* is functionality within the *Onewelcome Identity Cloud* that enables customers to configure and send notifications to their customers by SMS or e-mails.
Messaging service serves as a notification gateway for other Onewelcome products to unify the configuration of the notification channels.

Messaging service can send out sms/e-mails with the data directly embedded in the request, or can use templates from *Customer Self-Styling*.
Using templates gives customers to easily adjust the look of their notifications.
Messaging service uses [Mustache template language](https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache) for templating.
