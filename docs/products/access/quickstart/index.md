# Quick start

## Setup

Follow the steps in [configuration setup example apps](setup/example-apps-minimal-config.md) and you'll have a working setup for your mobile app. Now you can
start developing immediately. You can use this config to test and play with any of the example apps provided by Onegini.

After the minimal setup you're ready for the [next steps](setup/next-steps.md).

If you want to play with securing an API, but you don't have a resource gateway in your network, you can write your own by following our code example to
[secure resources](setup/securing-resources.md).
