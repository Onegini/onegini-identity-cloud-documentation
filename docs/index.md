# Onegini Identity Cloud

Onegini was founded in 2011 and supports today over 200 customer labels with over 45 million users spread over multiple countries. With Onegini Identity Cloud,
the company offers an omnichannel Customer Identity and Access Management solution (CIAM) for the banking, insurance and pension industry. With Onegini,
organisations quickly and securely create mobile apps and digital portals for consumers, employers and advisors while not having to worry about registration,
identification, login and management of the digital identity.

Onegini Identity Cloud for Developers describes the platform architecture, topic guides with concepts of CIAM, and in-depth documentation of our products.

## Which documentation should I use?

We are rewriting our documentation for the multi-tenant Onegini Identity Cloud. Eventually you will find all information about the Onegini Identity Cloud on 
this site.

Here you can find the latest multi-tenant documentation for:

* Mobile Identity & Access
* Delegated Administration
* Self styling

Navigate to the single-tenant documentation site on [docs-single-tenant.onegini.com](https://docs-single-tenant.onegini.com/) for:

* Identity & Single Sign-On
* Token Server, Security Proxy, and Extension Engine
* Customer Service

Contact [Onegini Support](https://support.onegini.com/) if you are not sure whether you are on the single-tenant or multi-tenant version of the Onegini Identity
Cloud.
