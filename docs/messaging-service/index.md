# Messaging Service

## What is the Messaging service?

The *Messaging service* is functionality within the *OneWelcome Identity Cloud* that enables you to configure and send notifications to your customers via SMS
or email. The Messaging service serves as a notification gateway for other OneWelcome products to unify the configuration of the notification channels.

Messaging service can send out sms/e-mails with the data directly embedded in the request, or can use templates from [*Customer
Self-Styling*](../self-styling/index.md). Using templates gives you the option to adjust the look of the notifications. The Messaging service uses
the [Mustache template language](https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache) for templating.
